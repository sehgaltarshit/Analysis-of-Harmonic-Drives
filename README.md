The SLP_presentation conatins the results of work to verify the kinematic model proposed in the paper uploaded here as "reference paper". This model proposed a 2D Harmonic drive model, the aim of the study was to verify the proposed model, and to check if using that model gives us constant angular speed at the output, which should be the case theoretically. And it turns out, it does
The tooth profile of the actual harmonic drive in the lab is used in the animation code, and is named as "tooth_profile"
The code for the animation is uploaded, as a MATLAB file named "harmonic_drive_animation_code". Please change the tooth_profile.csv file loaction beofre running the code
The part 2 of this study shifts the focus from kinematics of thr stress analysis.
The SLP2_presentation contains results for the stress variation in the flexspline when it is fitted onto the wave generator. 
The aim is to see how does change in the most common harmonic drive parameters affect the stress developed in the flexspline. 
Based on the results, model is made by curve fitting to estimate results for other new parameters wothout doing simulation
